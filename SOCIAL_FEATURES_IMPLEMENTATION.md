# Social Features Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of likes, views, and comments features for Free Fire account products.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Product Likes
- Users can like/unlike products
- Like count is displayed on product cards and detail pages
- Authenticated users only (requires login)
- Prevents duplicate likes from same user

### 2. Product Views
- View count is automatically incremented when product is viewed
- Works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Tracks unique views per user (if authenticated)
- Displays total view count

### 3. Product Comments
- Users can add comments to products
- Comments support likes and replies
- Character limits: 500 for comments, 300 for replies
- Users can delete their own comments
- Real-time display of comment count

## Backend Implementation

### New Models
- **Comment Model**: `/server/models/Comment.js`
  - Links to product and user
  - Supports nested replies and likes
  - Includes timestamps and validation

### Updated Product Model
- Added `likes` array with user references
- Added `views` counter and `viewedBy` array
- Added `commentsCount` field

### New API Endpoints

#### Product Social Interactions
- `PUT /api/products/:id/like` - Like/unlike a product (auth required)
- `POST /api/products/:id/view` - Record a product view (optional auth)

#### Comments
- `GET /api/comments/:productId` - Get all comments for a product
- `POST /api/comments/:productId` - Add a comment (auth required)
- `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` - Delete a comment (owner only)
- `PUT /api/comments/:commentId/like` - Like/unlike a comment (auth required)
- `POST /api/comments/:commentId/reply` - Reply to a comment (auth required)

### Updated Controllers
- **productController.js**: Added like and view functionality
- **commentController.js**: New controller for comment operations

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components
- **SocialActions**: Displays and handles likes, views, comments
- **Comments**: Full comment system with replies and likes
- **Updated ProductCard**: Shows social stats (likes, views, comments)

### Updated Pages
- **ProductDetailPage**: Includes social actions and comments
- **ProductCard**: Displays social interaction counts
- **MyProductCard**: Shows stats for user's own products

### API Services
- **commentAPI**: All comment-related API calls
- **socialAPI**: Like and view API calls

## CSS Styling

New CSS classes added to `components.css`:
- `.social-stats` - Social stats display in cards
- `.social-actions` - Like/view/comment buttons
- `.comments-section` - Comments container and styling
- `.comment-item` - Individual comment styling
- `.social-btn` - Interactive social buttons

## Features

### Like System
- Heart icon with count
- Visual feedback for liked state
- Prevents multiple likes from same user
- Real-time count updates

### View Tracking
- Automatic view recording on product access
- Eye icon with view count
- Anonymous and authenticated view tracking
- Prevents spam by tracking unique views

### Comment System
- Full threaded comments with replies
- Like functionality on comments
- Character limits with counters
- Delete functionality for comment owners
- Avatar display for commenters
- Timestamp formatting (relative dates)

### Social Stats Display
- Consistent display across all product cards
- Real-time updates
- Gaming-themed styling with glow effects
- Mobile-responsive design

## Database Migrations

### Social Fields Migration
- Adds default social fields to existing products
- Runs automatically on server startup
- Safe to run multiple times

### Usage
```javascript
// Migration is automatically run in server.js
addSocialFieldsToProducts().catch(console.error);
```

## Security Considerations

- Authentication required for likes and comments
- Users can only delete their own comments
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on social interactions (recommended)
- XSS protection on comment content

## Performance Optimizations

- Indexed queries for comments by product
- Pagination for comments (10 per page)
- Efficient aggregation for social stats
- Minimal database queries per request

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notifications**: Notify users when their products are liked/commented
2. **Advanced Comments**: Mention system, comment editing
3. **Social Analytics**: Detailed engagement metrics for sellers
4. **Comment Moderation**: Reporting and admin moderation tools
5. **Social Sharing**: Share products on social media platforms

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. Like/unlike products (logged in/out states)
2. Add/delete comments and replies
3. View count increment
4. Social stats display consistency
5. Mobile responsiveness
6. Error handling (network issues, auth failures)

### API Testing
- Test all endpoints with valid/invalid data
- Authentication state testing
- Rate limiting testing
- Database constraint testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Social stats not showing**: Check migration completion
2. **Authentication errors**: Verify JWT token handling
3. **Comment not posting**: Check character limits and auth
4. **View count not incrementing**: Verify API endpoint calls

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check product social fields
db.products.findOne({}, {likes: 1, views: 1, commentsCount: 1})

# Check comment counts
db.comments.countDocuments({product: ObjectId("product_id")})

# Verify indexes
db.comments.getIndexes()
```

This implementation provides a complete social interaction system that enhances user engagement while maintaining performance and security standards.
