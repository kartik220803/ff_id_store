## Visual Changes:

### Available Products:
- **Status Badge**: Green "AVAILABLE" badge with glow effect (top-right of image)
- **UID Display**: Cyan-highlighted UID in product details
- **Normal Styling**: Full color, no filters

### Sold Products:
- **Status Badge**: Black/gray "SOLD" badge (top-right of image)  
- **Image Effect**: Grayscale filter with reduced brightness
- **Text Effect**: Muted colors, strikethrough price
- **Overall Effect**: 75% opacity, darker appearance

### UID Field:
- **In Cards**: Cyan text with icon, displayed prominently
- **In Details**: Monospace font, cyan background, bordered
- **Form Input**: Standard input with validation and help text

## Testing Required:

1. **Add New Product**: Verify UID field is required and validates properly
2. **View Product Cards**: Check Available/Sold badges appear correctly
3. **View Product Details**: Verify UID and status display properly  
4. **Sold Products**: Confirm grayscale effect and muted styling
5. **Database Migration**: Ensure existing products get UIDs assigned
6. **Mobile View**: Check status badges are visible and properly positioned

## Technical Notes:

- UID field is unique across all products
- Migration runs automatically on server start
- Status badges use CSS gradients and blur effects for gaming theme
- Sold products maintain interactivity but with visual indication
- UID validation prevents duplicates and ensures proper format
